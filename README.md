# üéì PM_Prototype

## üìå Project Overview

![alt text](prototypePhoto.png)

**PM_Prototype** is a functional prototype of a VR-based educational platform. It simulates a virtual learning environment for students and lecturers, including immersive lectures, labs, campus exploration, mentoring sessions, and social spaces. It has been validated using mock data and tested with automated scenarios.
